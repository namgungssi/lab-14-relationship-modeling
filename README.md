## Test
* npm test (mocha)

Mongoose schema : pizza & beer (14)
To start, call the command mongod --dbpath=./db

#### Feature Tasks
* create an HTTP Server using `express`
* create a resource **model** of your choice that uses `mongoose.Schema` and `mongoose.model`
* use the `body-parser` express middleware to parse the `req` body on `POST` and `PUT` requests
* use the npm `debug` module to log the functions and methods that are being used in your application
* use the express `Router` to create a route for doing **RESTFUL CRUD** operations against your _model_

## Server Endpoints
### `/api/resource-name`
* `POST` request
  * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a post request to create a new resource

### `/api/resource-name/:id`
* `GET` request
  * should pass the id of a resource through the url endpoint to get a resource
    * **this should use `req.params`, not querystring parameters**
* `PUT` request
  * should pass data as stringifed JSON in the body of a put request to update a pre-existing resource
* `DELETE` request
  * should pass the id of a resource though the url endpoint to delete a resource
    * **this should use `req.params`**

### Bonus
* **2pts:** a `GET` request to `/api/resource-name` should return an array of stored resources
